Following stress, it is phosphorylated and activated by MAP kinase p38- alpha MAPK14, leading to phosphorylation of substrates. Phosphorylates serine in the peptide sequence, Hyd-X-R-X(2)-S, where Hyd is a large hydrophobic residue. MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3, share the same function and substrate specificity, but MAPKAPK3 kinase activity and level in protein expression are lower compared to MAPKAPK2. Phosphorylates HSP27 HSPB1, KRT18, KRT20, RCSD1, RPS6KA3, TAB3 and TTP ZFP36. Mediates phosphorylation of HSP27 HSPB1 in response to stress, leading to dissociate HSP27 HSPB1 from large small heat-shock protein (sHsps) oligomers and impair their chaperone activities and ability to protect against oxidative stress effectively. Involved in inflammatory response by regulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL6 production post-transcriptionally acts by phosphorylating AU-rich elements (AREs)-binding proteins, such as TTP ZFP36, leading to regulate the stability and translation of TNF and IL6 mRNAs. Phosphorylation of TTP ZFP36, a major post-transcriptional regulator of TNF, promotes its binding to 14-3-3 proteins and reduces its ARE mRNA affinity leading to inhibition of dependent degradation of ARE-containing transcript. Involved in toll-like receptor signaling pathway (TLR) in dendritic cells required for acute TLR-induced macropinocytosis by phosphorylating and activating RPS6KA3. Also acts as a modulator of Polycomb-mediated repression

Involved in the maintenance of telomeric DNA. Inhibits telomere elongation, de novo telomere formation and telomere addition to DSBs via catalytic inhibition of telomerase. Reduces the processivity of telomerase by displacing active telomerase from DNA ends. Releases telomerase by unwinding the short telomerase RNA telomeric DNA hybrid that is the intermediate in the telomerase reaction. Involved in the maintenance of ribosomal (rDNA). Required for efficient fork arrest at the replicaion fork barrier within rDNA. Involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial (mtDNA). Required to maintain mtDNA under conditions that introduce dsDNA breaks in mtDNA, either preventing or repairing dsDNA breaks. May inhibit replication progression to allow time for repair.

Breviolum249123	Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1C gives rise to L-type calcium currents. Long-lasting (L-type) calcium channels belong to the 'high-voltage activated' (HVA) group. They are blocked by dihydropyridines (DHP), phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and by omega-agatoxin-IIIA (omega-Aga-IIIA). They are however insensitive to omega-conotoxin- GVIA (omega-CTx-GVIA) and omega-agatoxin-IVA (omega-Aga-IVA). Calcium channels containing the alpha-1C subunit play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Binding of calmodulin or CABP1 at the same regulatory sites results in an opposit effects on the channel function

Cleaves the beta-aspartyl- glucosamine (GlcNAc) of the glycan and the amide side chain of Asn, converting Asn to Asp. Prefers proteins containing high- mannose over those bearing complex type oligosaccharides. Can recognize misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that are exported to the cytosol to be destroyed and deglycosylate them, while it has no activity toward native proteins. Deglycosylation is a prerequisite for subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of some, but not all, misfolded glycoproteins

Breviolum242252	Plays a central role in 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U at tRNA wobble positions of cytosolic tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln). Also essential during biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor. Acts by mediating the C-terminal thiocarboxylation of sulfur carriers URM1 and MOCS2A. Its N-terminus first activates URM1 and MOCS2A as acyl-adenylates (-COAMP), then the persulfide sulfur on the catalytic cysteine is transferred to URM1 and MOCS2A to form thiocarboxylation (-COSH) of their C-terminus. The reaction probably involves hydrogen sulfide that is generated from the persulfide intermediate and that acts as nucleophile towards URM1 and MOCS2A. Subsequently, a transient disulfide bond is formed. Does not use thiosulfate as sulfur donor

Acts in concert with a poly(A)-specific nuclease (PAN) to affect poly(A) tail shortening, which may occur concomitantly with either nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport or translational initiation. In the cytoplasm, stimulates translation initiation and regulates mRNA decay through translation termination-coupled poly(A) shortening, probably mediated by PAN (By similarity)

Breviolum51877	Plays a central role in 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U at tRNA wobble positions of cytosolic tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln). Also essential during biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor. Acts by mediating the C-terminal thiocarboxylation of sulfur carriers URM1 and MOCS2A. Its N-terminus first activates URM1 and MOCS2A as acyl-adenylates (-COAMP), then the persulfide sulfur on the catalytic cysteine is transferred to URM1 and MOCS2A to form thiocarboxylation (-COSH) of their C-terminus. The reaction probably involves hydrogen sulfide that is generated from the persulfide intermediate and that acts as nucleophile towards URM1 and MOCS2A. Subsequently, a transient disulfide bond is formed. Does not use thiosulfate as sulfur donor
